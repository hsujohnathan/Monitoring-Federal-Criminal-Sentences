# Monitoring-Federal-Criminal-Sentences
1996 - 2015

Since the establishment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1987 which introduced the gridline
system that was originally supposed to achieve a standarded procedure in sentencing, there has been a
popular literature that disproportionate sentences have been given to black males in the federal system. I
look to investigate some of the changes in different regions before and after certain landmark court cases, some
cases that come to mind are - US v. Booker (2005), Kimbrough v. US (2007), and US v. Dorvee (2010).
Challenges present here because we do not know where the disparity originates from, it could originate from different
points throughout the life of a case. In this project, I will focus on human discretion
discretion as we only observe the outcome of the case and the guideline values. Here are some of the outcomes
that I should consider - is the setencing on the lower end of the guidelines or the opposite (upward v.
downward departure/mandatory minimmum or no, 852 enhancement)? Are blacks given a higher sentence at
a higher frequency? Is that changing over the years?

them from ASCII for the data prior to 2005.
